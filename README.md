Introduction
------------

DoX is a feature-packed to-do list application.  DoXDroid uses a port of the Python base into Java, wrapped in a native Android application.

These instructions assume you will be using Eclipse.


Prerequisites
-------------

This app relies on the [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com) library to provide support down to Android 2.x.

* Download the library and add it to your workspace.
* From the DoXDroid project, go to Properties > Android > Libraries.
* Click Add, and include `actionbarsherlock`, then apply and close.


Importing the project
---------------------

* Pull a copy of the code.
* In Eclipse, go to File > Import > Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace.
* Select the `DoXDroid` folder, and copy the files into the workspace.
